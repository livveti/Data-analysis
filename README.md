# Background

Data is the past, the present and the future. Driven by the self-curiosity of recent data related jobs, this project was created to pin-point top-paid and in demand skills, as well as streamlining other works to find optimal jobs.

### The answers I was trying to seek through my SQL queries were: 
1. What are the top-10-paying data analyst jobs? 
2. What skills are required for these top-10-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most required for data analyst foles?
4. which skills are related to higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to master? 
# Tools I used

### In order to dive deep into data analyst job market, here are the tools I utilized to help me achieve:

- **SQL:** The bread and butter of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and discover critical insights.
- **PostgresSQL:** The ideal database management system to handle job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code(VSCode):** My choice of data management, code editing and SQL queries executing.
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for sharing my SQL analysis/scripts, ensuring collaboration and overall project tracking.
# The Analysis

Each query in this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data anaLyst job market. Here's how I approached each question: 
### 1. Top 10 Paying Data Analyst Jobs
To identify what the highest-paying opportunities are, I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs.The following query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.

```sql
SELECT 
  job_id,
  job_title,
  name AS company_name,
  job_location,
  job_schedule_type,
  salary_year_avg,
  job_posted_date::DATE
FROM job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
  job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
  salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL AND
  job_location = 'Anywhere'
ORDER BY
  salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT
  10
```
Here's the breakdown of the top 10 data analyst jobs in 2023:

1. **Wide range of salary:**  The yearly salary for data analyst span from $184,000 to $650,000, suggesting high salary potential in the field.
2. **Diverse employers:** Companies such as Meta, Pinterest, AT&T and SmartAsset are among the list, indicating a broad interest across different industries.
3. **Variety of Job Titles:** Job title varies from data analyst to director of analytics shows the overall variety of data analytics.
4. **Continuity of demand:** Job posted date span from January of 2023 to December of the same calendar year, shows that no matter the level of data analytics, demand of this field is continuous.

### 2. Required Skills For Top 10 Paying Data Analyst Jobs
To identify the skills required from the top 10 paying data analyst jobs, I expanded from my previous SQL query "Top 10 Paying Data Analyst Job", by creating a CTE, and connect tables to reference skills. This following query provides a more in-depth observation and shows what the essential skills are.

```sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS(
SELECT 
  job_id,
  job_title,
  name AS company_name,
  job_schedule_type,
  salary_year_avg
FROM job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
  job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
  salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL AND
  job_location = 'Anywhere'
ORDER BY
  salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT
  10
)
SELECT 
  top_paying_jobs.*,
  skills
FROM top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC
```
Here's the breakdown of the most demanded skills among the top 10 highest paying data analyst job in 2023:

### 5.  Most Optimal Skills to Learn for Data Analyst
Since I've covered the skill and salary aspect of this data, by combining job demand and salary data, this qeuery shows how I discovered the most optimal skills for data analyst, as well as what skills I should master for more potential opportunities.
I created 2 queries to make this happen, one with CTEs, the other one without. The outcome is the identical.

This query is done with CTEs.
```sql
WITH demand_skills AS(
SELECT
  skills_dim.skill_id,
  skills_dim.skills,
  COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS job_count
FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
  job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
  job_work_from_home = TRUE AND
  salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
  skills_dim.skill_id
),

job_count_salary AS (
SELECT
  skills_dim.skill_id,
  skills_dim.skills,
  ROUND (AVG(salary_year_avg), 0) AS avg_salary
FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
  job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
  salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL AND
  job_work_from_home = TRUE
GROUP BY
  skills_dim.skill_id
)

SELECT
  demand_skills.skill_id,
  demand_skills.skills,
  job_count,
  avg_salary
FROM demand_skills
INNER JOIN job_count_salary ON demand_skills.skills = job_count_salary.skills
WHERE
  job_count > 10
ORDER BY
  avg_salary DESC,
  job_count DESC
LIMIT 25
```
This query is done without CTE, the outcome is the same.
```sql
SELECT
  skills_dim.skill_id,
  skills_dim.skills,
  COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS job_count,
  ROUND(AVG(job_postings_fact.salary_year_avg), 0) AS avg_salary
FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
  job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
  job_work_from_home = TRUE AND
  salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
  skills_dim.skill_id
HAVING
  COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) > 10
ORDER BY
  avg_salary DESC,
  job_count DESC
LIMIT 25
```
